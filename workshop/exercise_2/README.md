# Workshop Exercise 2: Implementing logging best practices

The second exercise works with a dummy application that generates different logs with different formats. It logs them in different sources (files, TCP).

If it is not done already, [enable the log-management product in your Datadog application][6].

## Launch the script

In order to perform this exercise, we must spawn a vagrant VM. This allows us to work in a controlled environment, abstracting all potential OS related issues and making this work flow repeatable.

The OS distribution and version used for this exercise is `bento/ubuntu-16.04`. 

0. Go inside the `log-workshop/` folder that you [downloaded from Github](https://github.com/l0k0ms/log-workshop).

1. Start your vagrant VM:
  
    `vagrant up`

2. Connect to your Workshop vagrant box:
  
    `vagrant ssh`

3. Export your [Datadog API Key](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api):

    `export DD_API_KEY=<DD_API_KEY>`

    We export the Datadog API key in our current shell in order to be able to call it at any time with `$DD_API_KEY`. 

4. Go in the `/vagrant/workshop/exercise_2/` folder to start the exercise:

    `cd ~/vagrant/workshop/exercise_2/`

5. Launch the dummy script: 

    `python main.py &`

## Installing the Agent

To start gathering logs from our system, we can use any log shipper, but in order to benefit from the advantages displayed in exercise 1 of this workshop, we strongly advise you to use the Datadog Agent. To get the Datadog agent:

1. Connect to your [Datadog Application][2]
2. Install the Datadog Agent on your machine:

    ```
    DD_API_KEY=$DD_API_KEY bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/cmd/agent/install_script.sh)"
    ```

Once installed, you should see this in your shell:

```
Your Agent is running and functioning properly. It will continue to run in the
background and submit metrics to Datadog.

If you ever want to stop the Agent, run:

    sudo systemctl stop datadog-agent

And to run it again run:

    sudo systemctl start datadog-agent
```

This means that the Datadog agent is up and running and is ready to be configured.

## Gathering Data

We have 3 types of log: **full text** | **JSON** | **TCP**. ]We need to configure our agent accordingly: ([Log collection documentation][5])

To do:

* Enable log collection in `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml` by setting: `logs_enabled: true`

    `sudo vim /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml`

* Create a file `workshop.d/conf.yaml` in the ` /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/` folder with the following content:

    1. `sudo mkdir /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/workshop.d`
    2. `sudo vim /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/workshop.d/conf.yaml`
    3. Copy/Paste the following content inside the `conf.yaml` file

    ```
    logs:

      - type: file
        path: /vagrant/workshop/exercise_2/text_log.log
        service: text_log
        source: dummy_app
        sourcecategory: custom
        tags: workshop:exercise_2, type:text_log

      - type: file
        path: /vagrant/workshop/exercise_2/json_log.log
        service: json_log
        source: dummy_app
        sourcecategory: custom
        tags: workshop:exercise_2, type:json_log

      - type: file
        path: /var/log/datadog/*.log
        service: datadog-agent
        source: syslog
        sourcecategory: agent
        tags: workshop:exercise_2, type:datadog-agent

      - type: tcp
        port: 10514
        service: tcp_log
        source: dummy_app
        sourcecategory: custom
        tags: workshop:exercise_2, type:tcp_log
    ```

* Restart your agent `sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent`.

* Check if everything is running smoothly: `sudo datadog-agent status`.

## Exploring the data

Go into your [log-explorer view][6] and check that your logs are here.

## Processing data

### Full text logs

1. [Create a  pipeline][7] to parse full text logs **ONLY** (Set-up the correct filter on the pipeline `service:text_log`)

    ![text_pipeline](/workshop/exercise_2/images/text_pipeline.png)

2. Implement a Grok parser in this pipeline: 

    ```
    rule %{date("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS"):date} %{word:severity} %{word:user} connected to %{notSpace:http.url} it took %{number:http.response_time:scale(0.001)} s and ended up with the %{number:http.status_code} status code user agent used was %{data:http.user_agent}
    ```

    ![Text log parser](/workshop/exercise_2/images/text_log_grok_parser.png)

3. Implement a status remapping the main log status with [the log status remapper][9]

    ![text_log_remapping_severity](/workshop/exercise_2/images/text_log_remapping_severity.png)

The final pipeline should look like this:

![text_log_final_pipeline](/workshop/exercise_2/images/text_log_final_pipeline.png)

and transform this log:

```
2018-07-02 09:04:22.533142 EMERGENCY Jane connected to http://my.website_1.com/path/number/3/?query=param_1&var=foo_2 it took 4329000 s and ended up with the 503 status code user agent used was Mozilla/5.0%2520(X11;%2520Linux%2520x86_64;%2520rv:60.0)%2520Gecko/20100101%2520Firefox/60.0
```

into this log:

```json
{
    "date": 1530522262533,
    "http": {
        "response_time": 4329,
        "status_code": 503,
        "url": "http://my.website_1.com/path/number/3/?query=param_1&var=foo_2user_agentMozilla/5.0%2520(X11;%2520Linux%2520x86_64;%2520rv:60.0)%2520Gecko/20100101%2520Firefox/60.0"
    },
    "severity": "EMERGENCY",
    "user": "Jane",
}
```

### JSON log

1. [Create a  pipeline][7] to parse JSON logs **ONLY** (Set up the correct filter on the pipeline `service:json_log`)

2. Use [attribute remappers][10] to remap:
    * `user_agent` on `http.user_agent` 
    * `url` on `http.url`
    * `status_code` on `http.status_code`

The final pipeline should look like this:

![json_log_final_pipeline](/workshop/exercise_2/images/json_log_final_pipeline.png)

and transform this log:

```json
{  
   "user_agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_5) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/11.1.1 Safari/605.1.15",
   "response_time":9611,
   "url":"http://my.website_2.com/path/number/2/?query=param_2&var=foo_2",
   "status_code":"403",
   "message":"A user connected to a URL",
   "user":"Alice",
   "my_date":"2018-07-10 21:44:27.891783",
   "severity":"DEBUG"
}
```

into this log:

```json
{
    "http": {
        "status_code": 404,
        "url": "http://my.website_1.com/path/number/3/?query=param_1&var=foo_2",
        "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0%2520(X11;%2520Linux%2520x86_64;%2520rv:60.0)%2520Gecko/20100101%2520Firefox/60.0",
    },
    "my_date": "2018-07-10 21:45:58.065181",
    "response_time": 5874,
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "url": "http://my.website_1.com/path/number/3/?query=param_1&var=foo_2",
    "user": "Alice"
}
```

### TCP logs

1. Clone the Text log pipeline and rename it to TCP log pipeline.

2. Change the pipeline filter value to `service:tcp_log` to apply this pipeline only to TCP logs.

### Main processing pipeline 
The current pipelines should look like this:

![3_pipelines](/workshop/exercise_2/images/3_pipelines.png)

Now that all the different sources of logs have a unified format, let's create a main processing pipeline to enhance all our logs:

1. Create the pipeline:
    
    ![main pipeline configuration](/workshop/exercise_2/images/main_pipeline_conf.png)

2. Parse the `http.url` attribute with the [URL processor][11]
    
    ![url parser](/workshop/exercise_2/images/url_parser.png)

3. Parse the `http.user_agent` attribute with the [User Agent Processor][12]
    
    ![user_agent parser](/workshop/exercise_2/images/user_agent_parser.png)

4. Create attribute categories on the status code [with the categories processor][13]

    ![category processor](/workshop/exercise_2/images/category_processor.png)

The final pipeline should look like this:

![main_processing_pipeline](/workshop/exercise_2/images/main_processing_pipeline.png)

## Facets

Now that we have all our logs parsed and enhanced we can start adding our attributes as [facets][14].

**Note**: only new logs attributes are taken into account by the facets.

Add the `user`, `duration` attributes as facets.

1. Click on the attribute you want to define as a facet:
   
    ![creating facet](/workshop/exercise_2/images/creating_facet.png)

2. Configure your facet:
    
    ![configuring facet](/workshop/exercise_2/images/configuring_facet.png)

Facets can be used to filter, either on a string value or on a double/int range.

## Search 

Here are different searches to try out:

1. Search for all logs with `status_code` above 400

    `@http.status_code:>400`

2. Find all logs from the user `John`

    `@user_name:"john"`
 
## Log Graph

Looking at raw logs like this is useful, but if you want to make your log talk, switching to [Log graphs][15] allows you to do some TI (Technical Intelligence) with them. TI is like BI, but instead it's on Logs :)

![Log Graph](/workshop/exercise_2/images/log_graph.png)

Try to display:

*  The top `http.url`
*  The top `http.url` according to the duration
*  The top `http.url` from `user:john` with a `4xx` or `5xx` status code

## Monitor

Let's monitor those data, enter a query, and use it to define a monitor.
For instance, we could monitor the amount of `5xx` or `4xx` that are generated by our stack at any given moment.
