# log-workshop

This workshop aims to demonstrate the Datadog Log-management solution: first, by showing how to include log-management in larger troubleshooting logic and binding it with metrics and traces in order to reach 100% visibility upon your infrastructure; and second, by looking in depth at how Datadog features allow you to implement logging best practices within seconds, allowing you to implement Technical Intelligence.
